An operator is **a symbol that represents an operation to be performed with one or more operand.** Operators are the foundation of any programming language. Ruby supported operators are:

- Arithmetic Operator
- Bitwise Operator
- Comparison Operator
- Unary Operator
- Logical Operator
- Ternary Operator
- Range Operator
- Assignment Operator

## Arithmetic Operator


These are used to perform arithmetic/mathematical operations on operand. 


| Operator | Description                                                           |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `+`      | Add values from both sides of the operator.                           |
| `-`      | Subtract values from both sides of the operator.                      |
| `/`      | Divide left side operand with right side operand.                     |
| `*`      | Multiply values from both sides of the operator.                      |
| `**`     | Right side operand becomes the exponent of left side operand.         |
| `%`      | Divide left side operand with right side operand returning remainder. |


## Bitwise Operator


Bitwise operators **work directly on the binary representations of integers in memory**.


| Operator | Description          |
| -------- | -------------------- |
| `&`      | AND operator         |
| `|`      | OR operator          |
| `<<`     | Left shift operator  |
| `>>`     | Right shift operator |
| `^`      | XOR operator         |
| `~`      | Complement operator  |


## Comparison Operator


Comparison operator takes simple values as arguments and used to check for equality between two values.


| Operator | Description                                            |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `==`     | Equal operator                                         |
| `!=`     | Not equal operator                                     |
| `>`      | Left operand is greater than right operand             |
| `<`      | Right operand is greater than left operand             |
| `>=`     | Left operand is greater than or equal to right operand |
| `<=`     | Right operand is greater than or equal to left operand |
| `<=>`    | Combined comparison operator                           |
| `.eql?`  | Checks for equality and type of the operands           |
| `equal?` | Checks for the object ID                               |


## Unary Operator


Unary operator takes a single value as argument and operates on that.


| Operator | Description        |
| -------- | ------------------ |
| `!`      | Boolean NOT        |
| `~`      | Bitwise complement |
| `+`      | Unary plus         |


## Logical Operator


&& or “and” - AND operator, If both the operands are true, then the condition becomes true  


| Operator | Description                                                                  |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `&&`     | AND operator. If both the operands are true, then the condition becomes true |
| `||`     | OR operator. If any of the operands is true, then the condition becomes true |
| `!`      | NOT operator. Used to reverse the logical state of its operand               |


|| or “or” - OR operator, If any of the operands is true, then the condition becomes true 


! or “not” - NOT operator, Used to reverses the logical state of its operand.


## Ternary Operator


There is one more operator called Ternary Operator. It first evaluates an expression for a true or false value and then executes one of the two given statements depending upon the result of the evaluation


?: - Conditional Expression


```ruby
if condition ? true_part : false_part
```


## Range Operator


Range Operator is used to create a range of successive values - consisting of a start value, an end value, and a range of values in between.


| Operator | Description                                               |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `..`     | Creates a range including the last term. `1..5` ⇒ 1 to 5  |
| `...`    | Creates a range excluding the last term. `1...5` ⇒ 1 to 4 |


The (..) creates a range including the last term. `1..5` ⇒ 1 to 5


The (...) creates a range excluding the last term. `1...5` ⇒ 1 to 4


## Assignment Operator


Assignment Operator is used to assign a value to the operand


| Operator | Description                     |
| -------- | ------------------------------- |
| `=`      | Simple assignment operator      |
| `+=`     | Add assignment operator         |
| `-=`     | Subtract assignment operator    |
| `*=`     | Multiply assignment operator    |
| `/=`     | Divide assignment operator      |
| `%=`     | Modulus assignment operator     |
| `**=`    | Exponential assignment operator |
