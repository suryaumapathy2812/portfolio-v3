# **Functions**


Function is a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value. To qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output

- JavaScript functions are defined with the `function` keyword
- Function `parameters` are the names listed during the function definition.

### **Syntax**


```javascript
function functionName(parameter1, parameter2) {
  // code to be executed
}
```

- Function `arguments` are the real values passed to (and received by) the function when they are invoked.

### **Example**


```javascript
function addingTwoNumbers(number1, number2) {
  const sum = number1 + number2;
  return sum;
}

addingTwoNumbers(10, 542);
// the values 10 and 542 are the arguments that are
// being passed to the addingTwoNumbers function
```
