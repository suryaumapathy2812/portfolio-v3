The Web Storage API is a simple syntax for storing and retrieving data in the browser. The two mechanisms within the Web Storage are **`localStorage`** and **`sessionStorage`**


# Local Storage


**localStorage** is a property that allows JavaScript sites and apps to save key-value pairs in a web browser with no expiration date. A Storage object which can be used to access the local storage space of the current domain.


Simply put, the `localStorage` object stores the data with no expiration date. The data will not be deleted when the browser is closed, and will be available the next day, week, or year.

- _localStorage_ is bound to the origin (domain/protocol).
- Different protocols or subdomains have different storage objects.
- These different storage objects can't access data from each other.
- Capacity of `localStorage` is upto 10mb.

## Syntax


```javascript
window.localStorage
```


Saving a data to localStorage


```javascript
localStorage.setItem("key", "value");
```


Reading an item from localStorage


```javascript
const value = localStorage.getItem("key");
```


Removing an item from localStorage


```javascript
localStorage.removeItem("key");
```


Removing all items from localStorage


```java
localStorage.clear();
```


# Session Storage


The **sessionStorage** accesses a session Storage object for the current page. It is similar to the `localStorage` difference being that localstorage values doesn't expire, but the data in the `sessionStorage` is cleared once the page _session_ ends in other words when the page is closed.

- A **page session** lasts as long as the tab or browser is open.
- Opening a page in a new tab or window creates a new _session_.
- Opening multiple tabs/windows will creates `sessionStorage` for each tab/window.
- Duplicating a tab copies the tab's `sessionStorage` into the new tab.
- Closing a tab/window ends the session and clears objects in `sessionStorage`.
- Capacity of  `sessionStorage` is upto 5mb.

## Syntax


```javascript
window.sessionStorage
```


Saving a data to sessionStorage


```javascript
sessionStorage.setItem("key", "value");
```


Reading an item from sessionStorage


```javascript
const value = sessionStorage.getItem("key");
```


Removing an item from sessionStorage


```javascript
sessionStorage.removeItem("key");
```


Removing all items from sessionStorage


```java
sessionStorage.clear();
```
