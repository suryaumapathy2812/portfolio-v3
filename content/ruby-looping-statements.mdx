Looping in programming languages is a feature which clears the way for the execution of a set of instructions or functions repeatedly when some of the condition evaluates to true or false.


The loops in Ruby are :

- for loop
- while loop
- do..while loop
- until loop

```ruby
# Syntax

# for loop
for variable in expression do
	# code ...
end

# Example 
for i in 1..4  do
		puts "The value of i is #{i}"
end 
The value of i is 1
The value of i is 2
The value of i is 3
The value of i is 4
```


```ruby
# while loop
while condition
		# code ...
end

# Example
i = 0
num = 5

while i < 5 do
		puts "Inside the loop i = #{i}" 
    i +=1
end

Inside the loop i = 0
Inside the loop i = 1
Inside the loop i = 2
Inside the loop i = 3
Inside the loop i = 4
```


```ruby
# do..while loop
loop do
		# code ...
		break if booleanExpression
end

# Example
loop do   
  puts "Checking for answer"   
  answer = gets.chomp   
  if answer != '5'   
    break   
  end   
end
```


```ruby
# Until loop
until condition do
		# code ....
end

# Example 
i = 7

until i==10 do
		puts "the value of i is #{i}"
		i = i + 1
end
```
