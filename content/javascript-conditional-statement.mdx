In any programming language, Conditional statements are used to decide the flow of control or execution based on different conditions. If a condition is true, certain set of instruction is executed. If the condition is false, another set of instruction is executed.


Conditional statements control behavior and determine whether or not pieces of code can run. There are multiple types conditional statements

- `if` statement - specific block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
- `else` statement - specific block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is false
- `else if` statement - a new condition to test, if the first condition is false

## The `if` Statement


Use the `if` statement to execute a block of code, if a condition is true.


### Syntax


```javascript
if( condition ){
		// block of code to be executed
}
```


### Example


```javascript
const date = new Date();
const hour = date.getHours();

if( hour <= 12 ){
		console.log("Good Morning");
}

```


## The `else` Statement


Use the `else` statement to execute a block of code, if the condition is false.


### Syntax


```javascript
if( condition ){
		// block of code to be executed if condition is true
}else{
		// block of code to be executed if condition is false
}
```


### Example


```javascript
const date = new Date();
const hour = date.getHours();

if( hour <= 12 ){
		console.log("Good Morning");
}else{
		console.log("Good Afternoon/Evening");
}
```


## The `else if` Statement


Use the `else if` statement to specify a new condition if the first condition is false.


### Syntax


```javascript
if( condition1 ){
		// block of code to be executed if the condition1 is true
}else if( condition2 ){
		// block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true
}else{
		// block of code to be executed if both the conditions are false
}
```


### Example


```javascript
const date = new Date();
const hour = date.getHours();

if( hour <= 12 ){
		console.log("Good Morning");
}else if( hour <= 18 ){
		console.log("Good Afternoon")
}else{
		console.log("Good Evening");
}
```
