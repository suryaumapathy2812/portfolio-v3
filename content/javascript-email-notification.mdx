Go to Email Templates. 


Choose Create New Templates

Will save the template and Copy the template ID from the settings tab.


## Integration


Now Lets integrate EmailJS to our Application.


Go to Integrations > Browser.


Copy the code snippet to your project’s `.html` file

Now Create a `email.js` file in your project. 


Copy and paste the below code in to your `email.js` and paste your `service-id` and `template id` that we have copied earlier. 


```javascript
function sendEmailNotification(body) {
    emailjs.send(
        "service_3g4ehec",
        "template_ikz4w6w",
        body
    ).then(
        function (response) {
            console.log('SUCCESS!', response.status, response.text);
            // TODO: to do after Email is sent SUCCESSFULLY  //
						....
        }, function (error) {
            console.log('FAILED...', error);
            // TODO: to do if sending Email was UNSUCCESSFUL  //
						.....
        }
    );
}

const emailBody = {
    to_email: "to-email-address@something.com", // replace it with the receiver's email address
    to_name: " Yop-mail ",                      // replace it with the receiver's name
    message: "hello world",
}

sendEmailNotification(emailBody);
```


And thats it. 


To send the email, Construct an `emailBody` object and pass it as an parameter to the `sendEmailNotification` function.
