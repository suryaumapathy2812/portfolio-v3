# Folder Structure Conventions


> Folder structure options and naming conventions for software projects


### A typical top-level directory layout


```text
.
├── build                   # Compiled files (alternatively `dist`)
├── docs                    # Documentation files (alternatively `doc`)
├── src                     # Source files (alternatively `lib` or `app`)
├── test                    # Automated tests (alternatively `spec` or `tests`)
├── tools                   # Tools and utilities
├── LICENSE
└── README.md

```


> Use short lowercase names at least for the top-level files and folders except  
> LICENSE, README.md


### Source files


The actual source files of a software project are usually stored inside the
`src` folder. Alternatively, you can put them into the `lib` (if you're
developing a library), or into the `app` folder (if your application's source
files are not supposed to be compiled).


### Automated tests


Automated tests are usually placed into the `test` or, less commonly, into the `spec` or `tests` folder.


> Q: Why tests are placed into a separate folder, as opposed to having them closer to the code under test?


	**A:** Because you don't want to test the code, you want to test the _program_.


```text
.
├── ...
├── test                    # Test files (alternatively `spec` or `tests`)
│   ├── benchmarks          # Load and stress tests
│   ├── integration         # End-to-end, integration tests (alternatively `e2e`)
│   └── unit                # Unit tests
└── ...

```


### Documentation files


Often it is beneficial to include some reference data into the project, such as
Rich Text Format (RTF) documentation, which is usually stored into the `docs`
or, less commonly, into the `doc` folder.


```text
.
├── ...
├── docs                    # Documentation files (alternatively `doc`)
│   ├── TOC.md              # Table of contents
│   ├── faq.md              # Frequently asked questions
│   ├── misc.md             # Miscellaneous information
│   ├── usage.md            # Getting started guide
│   └── ...                 # etc.
└── ...

```
